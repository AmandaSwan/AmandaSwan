Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm fortunate enough to work with an insanely talented team of designers at GitHub. A few of the projects I'm most proud of are [the homepage](https://github.com/home), and [the new issues page](https://github.com/features/issues)...among a few other pages launching soon. âœ¨ ðŸš€ I'm now embarking on a new journey to pioneer a DesignOps practice; I'm using GitHub to make GitHub's Design Org even better. 

When I'm not working you can find me: 
- Hanging with my two boys 
- Skiing 
- Skate skiing
- Mountain biking
- Outside ðŸ˜„


[You can find me on LinkedIn here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amandaswan/)
